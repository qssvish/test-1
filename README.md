IONIC 2 GOOGLE MAP INTEGRATION:-

https://ampersandacademy.com/tutorials/ionic-framework-version-2/google-map-api-working-example

FIX ROOT PRIVILLAGES OVER IONIC CLI SCRIPTS:-

nautilus /usr/local -> This command will return you a path of you admin level environment variables.
Now use command:- 
export PATH="your path here for admin level".
Now you can build your ionic app easily.

IONIC PLUGIN CREATION STEPS:-

plugman create --name pluginname --plugin_id cordova-plugin-am-i-late --plugin_version 0.0.1

add platform-

plugman platform add --platform_name android

Java 8 features based on android:-

Supported Java 8 Language Features and APIs
Android does not support all Java 8 language features. However, the following features are available when developing apps targeting Android 7.0 (API level 24):

Default and static interface methods
Lambda expressions (also available on API level 23 and lower)
Repeatable annotations
Method References (also available on API level 23 and lower)
Type Annotations (also available on API level 23 and lower)
Note: Note: Type annotation information is available at compile time, but not at runtime. Also, the platform supports TYPE in API 24 and below, but not ElementType.TYPE_USE or ElementType.TYPE_PARAMETER..

To test lambda expressions, method references, and type annotations on earlier versions of Android, go to your build.gradle file, and set compileSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion to 23 or lower. You will still need to enable the Jack toolchain to use these Java 8 features.

Additionally, the following Java 8 language APIs are also available:

Reflection and language-related APIs:
java.lang.FunctionalInterface
java.lang.annotation.Repeatable
java.lang.reflect.Method.isDefault()
and Reflection APIs associated with repeatable annotations, such as AnnotatedElement.getAnnotationsByType(Class)
Utility APIs:
java.util.function
java.util.stream

Enable Java 8 Features and the Jack Toolchain
In order to use Java 8 language features, you need to also use the Jack toolchain. This Android toolchain compiles Java language sources into Android-readable DEX bytecode, has its own .jack library format, and provides most toolchain features as part of a single tool: repackaging, shrinking, obfuscation and multidex.

Here is a comparison of the two toolchains used to build Android DEX files:

Legacy javac toolchain:
javac (.java → .class) → dx (.class → .dex)
New Jack toolchain:
Jack (.java → .jack → .dex)
Configure Gradle
To enable Java 8 language features and Jack for your project, enter the following in your module-level build.gradle file:

android {
  ...
  defaultConfig {
    ...
    jackOptions {
      enabled true
    }
  }
  compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
  }
}
